To create beautiful layouts one must master the concepts of grids and flex-box

## Grids

- Grid Columns: number of columns of the grid
- Grid Rows: number of rows of the grid
- Gap: space between the grid items

## Flexbox

### Flex Direction

- flex-row: distribute items in a row direction, consecutive elements will be presented in a **horizontal** order
- flex-row-reverse: same as `flex-row`, but with the items sorted in a descending order
- flex-col: distribute items in a column direction, consecutive elements will be presented in a **vertically** order
- flex-col-reverse: same as `flex-col`, but with the items sorted in a descending order

### Align Items
- items-start
- items-center
- items-end
- items-stretch

### Justify Content
- justify-start
- justify-center
- justify-end
- justify-between
