# Team Members

![Members Dashboard](assets/members.png)

In the dashboard, you can invite other team members to collaborate with you on a project. Just type the user e-mail and click on the "Invite" button.

**Important: the user you are inviting should already have a Scribo account**

The invited user will be granted the "user" role, which is not allowed to edit your team's information and invite other members
