![Devices](assets/devices.png)

Right from the editor you can preview your page in multiple devices. At the center top of the editor you will find four icons, indicating the window size of the preview. Each device correspond to the following screen sizes:

| Device | Screen width   |
| -------- | ------ |
| Small Screen     | 400 pixels |
| Medium Screen     | 800 pixels |
| Large Screen     | 1100 pixels |
| Extra Large Screen     | 1920 pixels |

## Style for device

If you select any component in the page, at the right sidebar you will be able to change it's styles like background, typography, position and many more properties. If you came from a web development background, it is where you will edit the CSS of the component.

One important element of this sidebar is screen size selector, or breakpoints. It starts with a value of `Base`. As implied by it's name, all properties defined in this state will be apllyed to all screen sizes. If you change this select to, for example, `Medium`, you will notice that all values previously defined will disappear and you will be able to **overwrite** any property for that specific screen size.
