# History

As described on the [Save and Publish](./save-publish) docs, on Scribo, you have a "Development" and "Production" version. We provide a history drawer to keep track of the latter, which lists all the versions published.

On this list, you can roll back to an earlier version if your team publishes some critical bug on production. 
Clicking on the version, you have an option to overwrite the current "Development Version" too so that it will be equal to the version you are restoring.
